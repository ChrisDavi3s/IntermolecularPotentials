# IntermolecularPotentials

Q3.py Contains the code to Q1 and Q3. It contains a modified Q1 that can answer both parts.

calculate_omega.py is used in Q2. This code would actually be useful to incoroporate in Q3/1 as omege is used a lot and calculating it once as and then storing it as a constant would be an optimisation.

plot_diople.py and plot_induction.py are used in the analysis section.

The csv files are all labeled by charge (q) and intermolecular separation (r)
